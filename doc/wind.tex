\chapter{Wind Interpolation}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Introduction}

The wind data is given in a mesh and, possibly, in some set of random
points. We have to be able to restore the proper wind vector for any
ice element on a sphere. We also would like to have a few analytical
testing fields that we can use. This chapter describes all that
related to the wind.

\section{Analytitcal Testing Fields}

First field to use is taken from~\cite{bib:fuselier2009stability},
field~1, pp.~3233--3234.
