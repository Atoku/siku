\chapter{Diagnostics}

Diagnostics is a facility to calculate and output some values from the
model on a set of coordinates.

For each diagnostics, the user registers a function in python script
where the data from diagnostics will be transferred to. Together with
this function, the user provides and registers set of points,
a.k.a. ``mesh'' where the data will be calculated. The user also
schedules the runs such that diagnostics will be performed only when
necessary, not at each time step.
