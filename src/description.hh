  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p> Siku is a new discrete element method (DEM) sea ice model. The
  development started in 2013 at University of Alaska Fairbanks funded
  by BOEM (via Coastal Marine Institute) and Institute of Northern
  Engineering project</p>

  <h1>The Concept</h1>

  <p>The main idea behind sea ice DEM is to represent the ice sheet by
  a set of rigid polygons interacting with each other. Each polygon
  represents an ice element. The interaction between polygons mimics
  the interaction between ice floes. Although, ice elements are not
  ice floes themself as actual ice floes may be built from coaelsed
  ice elements. The model regional resolution can be expressed as a
  size of such an ice element and can vary over the Arctics depending
  on the accuracy needed in different regions</p>
